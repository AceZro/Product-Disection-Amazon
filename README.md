Case Study

Consider a customer who wants to buy a new laptop. They can use Amazon's search bar to find relevant products, filter results by specifications, and read reviews to make an informed decision. Once they've selected a laptop, they can add it to their cart, proceed to checkout, and track their order until it arrives.


Key Entities and Attributes:

 User: user_id, name, email, address, password_hash, credit_card_info, shipping_address
 Product: product_id, name, description, price, category, image_url, seller_id, inventory_level
 Order: order_id, user_id, order_date, shipping_address, billing_address, total_amount, status
 OrderItem: order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price
 Review: review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, text
 Cart: cart_id, user_id, items (a list of product IDs and quantities)

Rationale and Strategy

This schema design prioritizes flexibility, scalability, and performance. By normalizing the data and using appropriate data types, we can efficiently store and retrieve information. The relationships between entities are defined to support various use cases, such as generating personalized recommendations, analyzing sales trends, and processing orders.

Future Work

Additional Entities: Consider adding entities like Seller, Payment, and Shipping to capture more granular details.
Performance Optimization: Implement indexing and partitioning strategies to improve query performance, especially for large datasets.
Data Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive user information.
Scalability: Design the schema to accommodate future growth and increased traffic.

By understanding the intricacies of Amazon's data model, we can gain valuable insights into how to design efficient and scalable e-commerce platforms.
